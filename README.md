HOW TO BUILD:

For now, you just need to have premake (https://github.com/premake/premake-core) and execute premake5.exe with your configuration. 

e.g on a .bat file for visual studio 2017:

call vendor\bin\premake\premake5.exe vs2017



For now, the project is barely commented and there's room for a lot of clean up.
